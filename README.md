This program did not reach its finishes stages because of not having a design plan!

Majority of my programs I design and develop are planned and designed beforehand. There is an example of a project sprint plan I was undertaking during the summer below.

This program was created to help organise music, so musicians can send off a list of music to venues who know without sheets music.

Due to not having a design plan, there was no way to know how I am going to create the program. This was bound to fail and it did. 

Here is my project I tried to develop this summer 2020:

Initial Project Idea

Where the World Meet Project Summer 2020

A website that you can meet strangers from around the world, or you can choose on what country you want to meet people from. The website would be the safest chatting room ever. It would include recording or phone recording detection and the screen would blank out and display a warning message. On the website you choose to meet people based on your interests or just for a random choose. You are able to navigate to new person, if you are not interested in the person you are chatting to. 
For safety, it would include bullying, nudity detection, violence warning and this would be instantly removed and you will return to the home page with a warning message and will be banned from the site, if you do not knowledge the warning. This would use deep learning and neutral network to detect and inappropriate language or things appears on the screen.

The website will include all the modern UX features and be free of ads and data will not be sold. The website will have clear policy/ terms and homepage to say your data is safe and explain how you are doing it. 

Safety is the most important aspect of the website and will be deployed on AWS or another cloud platform, but not until fully finished for scalability and security. The website will be people funded and you can donate at the top right of the page, if the website is helping you
This website will help the world connect to each other and we will not be divided by borders no longer. 
Including the chatroom will be encrypted and any inappropriate language will be removed and dealt with. 
The initial idea is for meeting musicians from around the world and you can choice what type of instrument or just pick a genre of music you like and it will show you a random person. 

It would be designed for people with disabilities and follow all necessary accessibility guidelines and be able to use screen recorders. 
As well as video meeting there will be a chatroom for you to meet each other. But before you can use the website, you need to signup and show that you are not a bot and not on to cause harm, you will be asked a few questions. The chatrooms will be able to monitor harm or bulling behaviour and will ban the user. If the user is self-harming display a website for helplines in your local area. This will result in a ban, but will allow the use to see there is a way out of the dark. 
It will not cause issues with diversity; it will incorporate all aspects of culture and will not offend people.  

If you want to talk to a person again, you can send them a friend request and you can keep all the people and talk to the people you have met.
It will be very cautious of people sharing personal information and will be very clear in the rules, that is not allowed and also show information on how to be safe online for people to educate themselves. 

The steps of the project
1.	Write up a plan and design on what is required and use Scrum Agile for this project. 
2.	Before you can build the project, you need to work out and built basic features of the project before starting the sprints, otherwise you will not know what to do with project and how you are going to plan out the sprints. 
3.	Learn to use React, Helm (Kubernetes), APIs, Spring/ Spring Boot, Docker, Gradle, PostgreSQL 
4.	While doing the learning, learn to apply algorithms 
5.	Create a basic web app using React, PHP and create a webcam recording of both to another person. Or create a basic chat app to start off. 
6.	Create a detection algorithm that detects a tab opening and or tab being minimised and the screen of the other person will blank out and show a message. Try and develop something that detects a recording program being that is recording or being opened. Use a tracker that just monitoring the user’s movements on the computer without taking personal data and keeping the safety transparent. Make sure to do it in steps, keep I really simple and built it up until it works how it is intended. 
7.	Implement on AWS
8.	Create a basic neutral network that can detect objects on a webcam, first it would be phone that would need to be detected, violence as well and built up and training the network. If any behaviour was to be seen, then the screen will blank out totally and remove you from the website (ban). 
9.	Start your sprints and use the designs that you have created to build the project. Make sure to include privacy policy and safety information. Make sure the website follows modern UX principles and if you want more information, you can use another tab rather than having all the information in one page like most stranger meetup sites. 

# Here is the sprint plan for this program:

Where the World Meet Project

Product’s purpose (the client is myself)
I have been approached by a client to build a web chat app, that is safe and secure. The client has discussed that the project completion does not have to be a short timescale. All the client wants is for me to build an MVP, so that the client can show the investors of the viability of the project. The client understands that I am only a junior backend developer and is not looking for smart looking UI or frontend. All it needs to show is the potential of the product and how it could help her young teenage child to meet other people like her and play instruments with others. The client has given me an overview of the project idea:
A website that you can meet strangers from around the world, or you can choose on what country you want to meet people from. The website would be the safest chatting room ever. It would include recording or phone recording detection and the screen would blank out and display a warning message.

Target audience 
The main audience is between 16 to 50, as this is relative to if the person can use the website or not. However, this should not be an issue, as the website should be designed for all and should not need instructions to use.

# The reasons why it failed:

- The project I designed was too complicated for my level of understanding.
- I overstated my targets and though I could do anything (even if I am only finished first year of University).
- I used Socket.io, Express and React to design a basic program. Designing the socket.io part of okay, but when I got to create the react app I failed, due to not understanding the fundamental concepts of networking and WebRTC (this however I will learn this year!)

- This is an example of the socket.io code I used:

const express = require("express");

const http = require("http");

const app = express();

const server = http.createServer(app);

const socket = require("socket.io");

const io = socket(server);

// created a simple user object
const users = {}; </br>
// when a person connects, we are notifying the server that somebody has connected # and wants to keep track of this person </br>
// the socket represents a connection, a person that has connected to the server and </br>
// gets represented as the socket object </br>
// each socket has a unique idenifier </br>
io.on('connection', socket => { </br>
    if (!users[socket.id]) { </br>
        users[socket.id] = socket.id; </br>
    } </br>
    socket.emit("yourID", socket.id); </br>
    io.sockets.emit("allUsers", users); </br>
    socket.on('disconnect', () => { </br>
        delete users[socket.id]; </br>
    }) </br>
    // this is going to emit the an event called hey back out to the person who </br>
    // we are trying to call </br>

    socket.on("callUser", (data) => {
        // so the id we are going to call (userToCall), we are going to emit an event to that particular socket
        // that event is going to be called Hello
        io.to(data.userToCall).emit('Hello', {signal: data.signalData, from: data.from});
    })

    socket.on("acceptCall", (data) => {
        io.to(data.to).emit('callAccepted', data.signal);
    })
});

    server.listen(8000, () => console.log('server is running on port 8000'));

# Things that I have learned:

- Make sure to understand the concepts before applying them!
- If I am only a beginner developer, do not start developing intermediate programs before fully understanding the more advanced concepts or knowlege on how something works.
- Ask questions to more experienced developers, so I can learn from them. 
- Developing is nothing like catering, in catering it is fine to think you can cook anything from following a recipe, but does not work in programming.
- I have  learned that having transferrable skills does not mean you can do anything in programming. You have to learn from the ground up and keep working in steps until you are able to design the above program, rather than going full swing towards it.
